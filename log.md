Day 0:
Signed-up at DrivenData. 
Downloaded the Dataset for DengAI competition. 
Created project for this problem and imported data into python model. 
Performed data preprocessing by filling n.a. values and feature scaling. 
Since the data consist of a lot of weather information, I read the effect of weather on dengue from 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4784273/

Day 1: 

Todays Progress:  Ran xgboost regressor on yesterdays processed data with default hyperparameters. 

Thoughts: Since I did not do any feature engineerin other than preprocessing and scaling, the results weren't good.

Day 2 : 

Dengue Challenge isn't working for me. No idea what to do. Need to learn more about feature engineering. So going to take a step back to go to basics #100DaysOfMLCode.
Still, will not give up on this challenge.see you soon dengue

Day 3:

Signed up for ML track @DataCamp , so far so good. learnt many new things while completing the classification and regression section.
Implemented prediction and classification on the iris, Boston housing and gapminder datasets.
