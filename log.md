Day 0:
Signed-up at DrivenData. 
Downloaded the Dataset for DengAI competition. 
Created project for this problem and imported data into python model. 
Performed data preprocessing by filling n.a. values and feature scaling. 
Since the data consist of a lot of weather information, I read the effect of weather on dengue from 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4784273/

Day 1: 

Todays Progress:  Ran xgboost regressor on yesterdays processed data with default hyperparameters. 

Thoughts: Since I did not do any feature engineerin other than preprocessing and scaling, the results weren't good.
